# Face Recognition Attendance System

A simple and clean Python-based face recognition attendance system that registers students, trains a face recognition model, and marks attendance automatically.

## Features

- ✅ Register students with unique registration numbers
- ✅ Capture 10 photos per student for training
- ✅ Train face recognition model
- ✅ Automatic attendance marking via camera
- ✅ Save attendance records in JSON format
- ✅ View registered students and attendance history

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python attendance_system.py
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Register a Student
- Choose option 1 from the menu
- Enter student name and registration number
- The camera will open
- Press SPACE to capture each of the 10 photos
- Press ESC to cancel

### 2. Train Model
- Choose option 2 from the menu
- The system will load all registered student photos
- The model will be trained and saved automatically

### 3. Mark Attendance
- Choose option 3 from the menu
- The camera will start
- Stand in front of the camera
- If recognized, attendance will be marked automatically
- Press ESC to exit

### 4. View Students
- Choose option 4 to see all registered students

### 5. View Attendance

## File Structure

```
attendance_data/
├── students/              # Student photos
│   └── [reg_number]_[name]/
│       ├── photo_1.jpg
│       ├── photo_2.jpg
│       └── ...
├── models/               # Trained model
│   └── face_model.yml
├── attendance/           # Attendance records
│   └── attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.json
└── students_db.json      # Student database
```

## Attendance Records Format

Attendance is saved in JSON format:
```json
{
    "REG001": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "reg_number": "REG001",
        "time": "09:30:15",
        "status": "Present"
    }
}
```

## Tips

- Ensure good lighting when capturing photos
- Look directly at the camera during registration
- Capture photos from slightly different angles
- The system marks attendance only once per day per student
- Lower confidence values mean better matches (threshold is 70)

## Future Enhancements (You can add later)

- Export attendance to Excel
- Email notifications
- Multiple camera support
- Web interface
- Mobile app integration

## Troubleshooting

**Camera not working:**
- Check if your webcam is connected
- Ensure no other application is using the camera
- Try changing `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

**Model not recognizing faces:**
- Ensure you've trained the model (option 2)
- Register more students for better accuracy
- Improve lighting conditions
- Capture training photos with varied expressions

**Installation issues:**
- Make sure you have Python 3.7+
- Install Visual C++ redistributables (Windows users)
- Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts
